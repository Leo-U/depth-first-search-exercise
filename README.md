This code is converted to Ruby from C++ by ChatGPT for personal educational purposes.

The original C++ code is from https://gist.github.com/mycodeschool/10016271. I retrieved that link from the description of this YouTube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8DUJJhmY4

This exercise is a continuation of my previous exercise:
